## How this folder is structured

In this folder there are images of the Narrative Arc/Front-End Blueprint.
There are two images because we thought of two ways of displaying this. One with each element (View, ViewModel, FE Services) individually connected to its place; and another with a table with every element of that place together. These are separated so the user can choose whichever one they are more comfortable with.
The files are named using the following naming convention: `marrative-arc-[type].png`, where by `[type]` we mean the type of view of the Narrative Arc 'Scheme' or 'Tables'.
