## How this folder is structured

In this folder there are images of the Microfrontends and a `.md` file which corresponds to the Architectural Design Record (ADR) of the Microfrontend.
These ADRs are a justified design choice that address a functional requirement that is architecturally significant and its rationale.
The files are named using the following naming convention: `[name_of_microfrontend]_*.png`, where `*` means that it can have multiples of `[name_of_microfrontend]`; and `MFE_[name_of_microfrontend.md]`.
