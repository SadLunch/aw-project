## Introduction

In this part of the project our group had to create the Back End Orchestration with the Back End Services, Resources, Request and Response Schemas.
In this folder we have our proposed solutions as a `png` file named `Workflow[number_of_workflow].png`.

## Proposed Solution

We created 2 workflows:
 - One for a User Authentication narrative
 - And one for a Give Feedback to a Product narrative

In these images the flow of operations is shown as 1 → 2, but it is actually read as 2 → 1.
For example:
 - In workflow 1 we read *"For a user to be able to login to the application, he needs to be registered in the application"*
 - In workflow 2 we read *"For a user to be able to give feedback, he needs to have a token saying that he is logged in, and before that he needs to have chosen a product"*
